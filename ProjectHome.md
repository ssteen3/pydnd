The goal of this project is to create an engine that will work, feel, and somewhat look like DnD. The combat will be based on 3.5 rules and therefore be grid based. Most rolls will be made apparent to the player but they will not be made by the player. The final project will include network playability, DM options, and an interface to preprogram story-line with no DM required for play.
